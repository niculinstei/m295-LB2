# Tests

The tests are exported from Postman. They can be easily imported back into hoppscotch. It has 2 requests for each endpoint, one which fails and one which should work if you are logged in.

Exportfile: /workspaces/m295-LB2-3/LB2.postman_collection.json

If you are not logged in, u can't call any endpoint.
You only can see your own tasks. So if you logged in with email banane@gurke.ch and the password m295 you can only see the task with author banane@gurke.ch.
